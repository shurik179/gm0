Game Manual 0 would not have been possible without the many contributors who
have sacrificed their precious freetime
(or merely found another excuse to procrastinate their work).
I am especially grateful to Ben and Dan for helping port over Game Manual 0 to
Copperforge,
and for all those who have continued to add and revise GM0 during the busy
school year.
GM0 had been my dream for quite some time,
and as an alum tremendously grateful for all that FIRST has taught me,
I wanted to create GM0 to preserve and spread the knowledge base that might
have been lost with the FTC class of 2019 and beyond.
For this reason, I wanted to recognize all the contributors who have helped to
make GM0 a great resource for FIRST Tech Challenge teams.
Feel free to contact any of the names listed below via the email
(gamemanual0@gmail.com) or through the other contact emails -
I’m sure that they would be more than willing to help you out!
