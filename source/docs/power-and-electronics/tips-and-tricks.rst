Tips and Tricks
===============
In addition to what is written in the official resources,
there are a couple of additional tips.

The traditional XT30 connector that is used by REV Roboics is prone to breaking.
It is highly recommended that teams replace XT30 connectors with Anderson
Powerpole, or put adapters on their current wires.
An example of an adapter is
`this <https://www.servocity.com/anderson-powerpole-to-female-xt30-adaptor>`_.
In lieu of this, teams can also 3D print strain relief connectors on the
Expansion Hub to prevent XT30 disconnects.
The file can be found on Thingiverse or through this
`link <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2887045>`_.

The Tamiya connectors found on many of the FTC legal batteries are very weak
and prone to becoming unreliable after 10-20 repeated plug/unplug cycles.
It is recommended that teams crimp new Anderson Powerpole connectors onto the
battery.

It is highly recommended for teams to use the
`REV grounding strap <http://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1269/>`_
and the
`REV USB strain relief <http://www.revrobotics.com/rev-41-1214/>`_
to help prevent disconnections.

To protect wires, teams often use
`wire loom <https://www.amazon.com/Black-Split-Tubing-Cover-Marine/dp/B00J7RD6ZI/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=wire+loom&qid=1562452458&s=gateway&sr=8-13>`_,
or `split cable sleeve <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FWC1XQZ/>`_

To help wires extend far (for example, when used with vertical lifts)
teams often use cable carrier (also known as `cable chain <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WJ4CPF5/>`_).
Another option is using a coiled cable such as `this one <https://www.cablescience.com/electronic-coiled-cord-20-gauge-with-3-conductors.html>`_
(requires soldering appropriate connectors). Note that you should pay attention
to wire gauge - by FTC rules, servo wires should be 22AWG or larger (20 is
recommended for long runs), and motor wires should be 18AWG or larger.
For example, typical  coiled phone cable uses 26AWG wires and therefore is not legal for FTC use.
