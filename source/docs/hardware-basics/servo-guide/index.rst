Servo Guide
===========
A servo combines a small electric motor and control circuit in a single compact
package. This allows the servo to rotate to a specified position and hold that
position. Typically servos have very  limited range of rotation
(180° is common).

**Servos are NOT replacements for DC motors, and should not be used
as such. Servos are made for fine-tuned and accurate movement, not high-load
or fast rotation applications.**

Servos are commonly used in RC cars (steering) and RC planes (moving ailerons).
In FTC, servos are typically used for claws, grabbers, and arms.

There is a huge variety of servos from different manufacturers, which vary
widely in price, performance and value. Fortunately, virtually all servos use
the standard 3-wire connector, and accept the same kind of controlling signal
(PWM signal at 50 hz). REV Expansion hub provides 6 servo ports, so you
can plug in a servo from any manufacturer. Also, virtually all servos use one
of common servo sizes, so you can use the same mounts for them. Common general
use servos used in FTC are the REV Smart Servo and  goBILDA Dual mode Servo
(25-2), but you should  check out other servos as well.  Picking the right
servo for your application is a question that’s almost impossible to give
a blanket answer for.To learn more, please read the
:doc:`Choosing a servo<choosing-servo>` section below.

Biggest problem with servos is durability: internal servo gears in cheaper
servos strip easily  when subjected to shock loads. Servos are also very
bad at handling lateral  loads or bending of the shaft. To avoid having to
frequently replace servos,  choose ones with metal gears and read the usage
suggestion section below.
