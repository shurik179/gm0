In this section we list some servos with unique features.

HS788 Sail Winch Servo
----------------------
This large scale servo is unusual in that it is able to rotate multiple turns
while retaining positioning feedback. Most servos have 180 degree range; for
HS788, the range is about  8 full turns when used with a servo controller
capable of 500-2500 microsecond PWM signal, such as REV expansion hub. This
makes it a great option for powering linear slides (as long as they do not
carry too heavy load).

HS788 is available from several vendors including Servocity and goBILDA,
both of which offer 25% discount to FTC teams.

PARALLAX High Speed CR Servo
----------------------------
This continuous rotation servo from Parallax
(https://www.parallax.com/product/900-00025) has the speed of up to 180 RPM -
three times as fast as most servos.
This makes it usable for powering intakes
(assuming you do not need much torque)
and similar designs. Note that this servo requires 6V input, so it can not be
used  directly with REV hubs, which only provide 5V. Instead, you need a
`REV Servo Power Module <http://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-1144/>`_.
