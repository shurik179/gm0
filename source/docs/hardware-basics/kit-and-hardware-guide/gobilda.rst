=======
goBILDA (https://www.gobilda.com/) is a fixed-pitch, channel based building system
that was fully released in the 2018-2019 season. In many ways it is similar to
Actobotics (and in fact
is created by the same company); unlike Actobotics, it is based on metric
measurements, featuring hole pattern with 4mm holes on 8mm grid, M4 screws,
8mm pitch chain, HTD 3 or HTD 5  belt, and metric shafts (6mm D and 8mm rounded
hex). The principal structure pieces of goBILDA are  48mm aluminum U-channels
shown below.

In addition, goBILDA provides  low-side channel (smaller profile channel)
to supplement full size U-channel, measuring just 12mm height and allowing
for more compact builds.

Even though this may initially seem like a stepback,
the use of low side channel opens up many new possibilities such as a kit-based
parallel plate drivetrain.


goBILDA’s robust motion system, which is all metric, allows teams to easily
build drivetrains and mechanisms without worrying about placement and
tensioning. goBILDA mostly uses clamping hubs, eliminating the unreliable set
screws.

Additionally, goBILDA is still being developed at a quick pace and is
responsive to the needs of the FTC community.

Advantages
==========
* goBILDA's low-side U-channel opens up many new possibilities due to its
  flexibility and compactness.
  For example, one can now make a parallel plate drivetrain without custom
  machining, or make custom width U-channel.
* goBILDA also has ServoBlocks
  (identical to Actobotics other than hole pattern)
  which drastically increase servo life.
* goBILDA has native large bore hex shaft support
  (12mm REX is comparable to 3/8" Thunderhex) which is one of the main
  advantages of custom fabrication brought to a kit based system.
* goBILDA also is able to interface with TETRIX channel because they share some
  holes.
  For more information about TETRIX-goBILDA compatibility,
  check out this `website <https://gobildatetrix.blogspot.com/>`_.
* goBILDA has a well thought-out ball bearing based motion system with smart
  motion transfer.
  It is easy to do chain or belt in channel.
  8mm chain and HTD 3 and 5 mm  belt can do perfect C2C (center to center) on
  the goBILDA pattern.
* goBILDA has plenty of shaft, ball bearing and pillow block options.
* goBILDA motors can face mount natively into channel,
  eliminating the need for motor mounts and providing a robust, reliable way to
  mount motors.
* goBILDA has some special parts are unavailable in other systems,
  like square beam shafts.
* goBILDA provides a large selection of 12V DC motors. Their Yellow Jacket
  motors use orbital gearboxes (which are more reliable than spur gears) and
  are available in 10 different gear ratios, ranging from 30 RPM (and enough
  torque to twist off 6mm steel  shaft) to speedy 1620 RPM.

Disadvantages
=============
* goBILDA is not the cheapest build system;
  it is relatively equivalent in pricing to Actobotics, but REV is cheaper.
* goBILDA U-channels are larger than the channels from Tetrix, resulting in
  larger builds. However, this is more than compensated by the fact that one
  can put a goBILDA motor *inside* a channel
* Because of metric pattern spacing, goBILDA utilizes 8mm pitch chain,
  as opposed to the FTC standard #25 Imperial chain.
  This means that other kits' chain and sprockets won’t work with goBILDA chain
  and sprockets.
