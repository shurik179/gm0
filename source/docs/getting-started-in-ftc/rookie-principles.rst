Rookie Mistakes: Principles
===========================
Here are some common mistakes that teams make in the high-level design
and strategic planning stages.

Do Everything At Once → Perfect One Objective First
===================================================
**Consistency is king.**
A common pitfall for first year teams is trying to accomplish all the game
objectives at once, especially in tele-op and endgame.
**This is highly discouraged** because oftentimes new teams do not have the
experience to do so.
It is no small achievement to have a consistent robot that completes all
objectives
in competition, even at the higher levels.
Too often, we see teams bring half-baked robots that will attempt to do
everything in a match, but excel at nothing. Even if they succeed, it is often
by thin margins and cannot be repeated.
This robot could be much more successful if the team spent their time to
perfect one mechanism first.
Teams should always remember the principle that a robot that can complete one
thing consistently will likely be more competitive than the robot that does
everything inconsistently.
We recommend teams focus on one objective during tele-op/endgame and perfect
it.

**Typically, teams which have a solid autonomous and consistent endgame can be
competitive at the Qualifier level**,
and this is a recommended goal for new teams.

Overcomplicate → Simplify
=========================
**Simplifying your robot simplifies possible headaches later.**
Another common trap that teams fall into is to overcomplicate needlessly.
Simplicity and compactness are two hallmarks of engineering.
While some robots are very complicated,
keep in mind that those teams are generally experienced, have some sort of
machining capability, and fully design their robot in CAD.
However, many world-class teams often build designs that are ingenious yet
ridiculously simple.
Some advantages to simplicity are that the robot has less points of
failure, given that the robot has less moving parts.
Additionally, it takes much less time to iterate through and perfect a simple
mechanism as opposed to a complicated one. The reasoning is that a complicated
system has many more variables that need to be adjusted/could cause problems.
Keeping things simple can be practically achieved through a couple of ways.
First, try to limit the degrees of motion that the mechanism operates in.
For example, a linear slide goes in and out in a straight line, as opposed to
an arm, which rotates along an axis.
Doing so will serve to eliminate forces that otherwise could adversely affect
the mechanism.
Another way to simplify is to build for the shortest travel distance.
Obviously, the shortest distance from A to B is in a straight line,
so teams should strive to keep the game elements approximately within a
reasonably straight line.
This can help in solving possible problems if the game elements need to change
direction too many times.

Score-first designs → Design for Consistency
============================================
**Teams should prioritize consistency over scoring ability.**
The tortoise beats the rabbit.
An overused parable, but it still holds a kernel of truth.
Why?
Because the tortoise, which plodded along consistently, beat the rabbit,
which had hot and cold streaks.
A hallmark of any successful team is consistency and reliability throughout the
competition season and even across seasons. Sports dynasties are dynasties for
the reason that they compete at a high level not for a couple games, but for
multiple seasons.
Without the power of consistency, it will be nearly impossible to win games,
let alone a tournament.
Too many teams fall into the pit of prioritizing scoring ability more than
anything else, which is a grave error.
In keeping with the first tip, to perfect one objective first,
this practice will serve to increase consistency.
**While scoring ability should be a priority and objective when designing
mechanisms, it is not everything in this game.
We advise being consistent at low and medium scoring levels than inconsistently
scoring at a high level.**
Focus on being able to do that one thing every single time throughout your
matches, and you will begin to see how important consistency is.
**This tip is equally as important during alliance selections.
Top teams will prioritize teams that are consistent far more than scoring
ability.**
They are not afraid to look at teams who can’t score much, but can contribute
every time to the alliance score, rather than selecting a boom-or-bust pick.

Build haphazardly → Build for reliability
=========================================
**Build for the worst case scenario, not the best case scenario.**
When building, teams often overlook a key principle: build for reliability.
All too often, teams skimp on the quality of construction as well as materials,
which leads to one of the most common reasons for unsuccessful tournaments:
part failure.
Teams also do not take into account the rigors of competition and build as if
the robot will not encounter opposing robots.
Sufficient driver practice will be able to better simulate in-game conditions
and test the reliability of the robot.
To remedy this problem, refer to the
:doc:`Materials Guide <../hardware-basics/materials-guide>` to gain a better
understanding of what materials are recommended for use.
If possible, teams should build with redundancy in mind. For example, if one
set of linear slides fails due to a wire snapping,
having a second set will still allow the robot to operate
instead of sitting dead in the water.
Practically, doubling mechanisms, motors, and servos is a common method to
build for redundancy.
In addition, teams often forget to account for twisting or compression forces
that may occur upon the mechanism.
While we cannot give any specific recommendations, do keep in mind what forces
the support structure of your mechanism must bear along the full range of
motion, and account for what occurs when it might hit another
robot/field wall/field.
Building more robustly is always worth the time spent.
However, it is good to think about the extra weight that results.
Furthermore, a common cause of robot disconnect is wiring issues.
Refer to the :doc:`Wiring section <../power-and-electronics/wiring>` for more
information; in short, make sure to plan ahead and leave space for wires,
and use strain relief whenever possible.
All these tips combined will help your robot become more reliable,
a key characteristic of all world-level robots.

Fret about Design → Focus on Execution
======================================
**A good execution of a bad design will beat a bad execution of good design.**
FTC is all about how well you execute in both the mechanical aspect and the
driver aspect. If your goal is winning, then how mechanically beautiful your
robot is doesn't matter. Your goal is less of impressing the judges but
performing the best you possibly can on the field.
It is very possible to take a bad design, execute it well, and still be
competitive at a high level.
Even though not many teams are able to do so, it still goes to show that the
method of implementation is very important.
When brainstorming designs, try not to get hung up on small details if
possible.
It is important to discuss different designs and debate the pros & cons, but
after a design has been picked, stay with it unless there are major flaws that
were originally overlooked.
Changing designs will throw away the time spent on the original design, when
teams could have kept improving it or practiced more.
It is possible to rebuild your robot mid-season, and many top teams have done
so to great success.
However, this is not recommended for rookie and new teams due to the general
lack of experience. Realistically, expect to spend 50-100+ hours
to rebuild a robot from the ground up.
Focus on how you can iterate your current design to be as effective, efficient,
and refined as possible.
